# My_TimetableBot
My timetable bot is an automated assistant designed to make daily schedules simple and stress-free. It automatically sends the daily timetable at 8:00 AM every day without requiring any input. Built using Python and scheduling libraries, the bot fetches data from a CSV file and delivers the right subjects, timings, and tasks for the day.
